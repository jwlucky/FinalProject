This is my Final Project for the Master of Computer Science degree. 

For dataset I choose the U.S. National Library of Medicine. 
It contains 1015 single chunks, approximately 40 mb for each chunk. After unzipping the total data size is above 300 GB, between 300 GB and 400 GB. 

Though the Winter semester started in January, in the first month I learned the fundamental skills about Data Analysis. I followed this book: Python for Data Analysis Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython(2nd).pdf

This project was officially started on Feb 15.
