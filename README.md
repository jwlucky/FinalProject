This is my Final Project for the Master of Computer Science degree. 

For dataset I choose the U.S. National Library of Medicine. 
It contains 1015 single chunks, approximately 40 mb for each chunk. After unzipping the total data size is above 500 GB. 

Though the Winter semester started in January, in the first month I learned the fundamental skills about Data Analysis. I followed this book: Python for Data Analysis Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython(2nd).pdf

This project was officially started on Feb 15. 

Main contents:

• Utilizing Memorial University Computing Resources to process large XML raw Dataset from U.S. National Library of Medicine.
• Implementing Python scripts on Jupyter Notebook along with Pandas, NumPy libraries to perform Data Extractions, Cleaning, and Manipulations.
• Visualizing data by plotting medical topic trends, popular academic fields and citation network graphs utilizing matplotlib, snap.py, gnuplot, and graphviz.
